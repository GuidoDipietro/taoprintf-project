# How to use

Compile `tua2` with `make tua2`.

Create a new file called `whatever.c` and dump the output of `tua2` into it, with `./tua2 > whatever.c`.

You didn't have to do in anyway, because that new file is identical to `tua.c`.

Compile `tua.c` with `make tua`.

Run and enjoy.

`tua.c` is the file that triggered this entire project, so to call it. Appreciate it.
