# How?

This was, I believe, one of my first attempts at this _taoprintf_ frenzy.

Compile with `make`, execute `./tao`, and you can see the Name being printed, followed by the source code of the `yes.c` file.

Fairly simple entry, but it was something I was very pleased with.

I've also included the `no.c` file, which is not related to the *TaoYuPrintf* project, but has a very similar structure to `yes.c`, though much better IMHO. (Check [this repo](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/Motivacion-UTNSO) and translate the `README.md` for background.)

Wanna know how to do this?  
Ok, if you speak Spanish read [my blog post](https://laspreguntasdeguido.blogspot.com/2021/04/programas-autorreplicantes-guia.html).

You don't? Well, Google-translate it, I guess, or perhaps follow the code snippets.  
I don't really feel like translating it, it is actually pretty simple enough to follow! (I hope)
