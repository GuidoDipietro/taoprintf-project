# A birthday party unlike any other

Tao Yu, as well as everybody else, has a birthday.  

The day it comes, you better be well prepared.  

Tao Yu himself once stated: "I dislike birthdays!" Therefore, we shouldn't wish him a happy birthday.  


If you're invited, come and join us on this birthday celebration with cake and plants.
