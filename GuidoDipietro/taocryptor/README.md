# How tf to use??

Welcome to this adventure.  
*DISCLAIMER:* This one is SO epic that is has [its own repo](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/most-esoteric-C-project-ever). You have been warned.

First of all, start by creating the `me.c` file.  
You can do that by running `make make`.

Remove the first 14 lines of the `me.c` file, which is just the content of `make.c` (it is a semi-quine!).  
Maybe do this by editing it with `vim me.c` and executing `14dd`.  

Now, you will see there is a line saying `#include <tao.bfk>`. There is no such file, so you will have to create it by running `make bfk`.

Once you have, compile `me.c` with `make me`.  
Get ready for the following two steps.

Resize your terminal font size (try `Ctrl`+mouse wheel, or Google how to do it on yours), until it is *very, very, very* small. I'm talking miniscule here.

Now, run `./me`, and enjoy.

You can guess who that is.

You can always clean it up with `make clean` when you are done playing.
